	abstract = {Oil production has been the leading sector of the Venezuelan economy for more than 80 years. In this context, oil has played a very significant role in the type of federalism that has taken root in Venezuela. The power of the purse of the national executive, which concentrates oil revenues, is such that all subnational authorities are dependent on the president and have very little autonomy. While the oil sector has been in the center of political conflict, the most significant dimensions of the conflict have not been centered on regional issues, but rather on social and ideological ones. However, in 1996, at the initiative of the oil jurisdictions, a law was approved where part of the income from the hydrocarbons sectors would be allocated to oil producing states and municipalities. However, this reform suffered the same fate of all decentralization efforts after the constitutional reform in 1999. A variety of measures has been taken to reduce revenue sharing of the oil revenues.},

	abstract = {The concept of a low-carbon transition is increasingly gaining traction in South Africa. This constitutes a major technical, social and political challenge as the national energy sector highly depends on coal. Analysing the driving factors for the ongoing dominance of coal, this case study identifies main actors, objectives, and the relevant contextual factors forming the political economy of energy and coal. For this purpose, a qualitative analysis of semi-structured expert interviews was carried out. The findings yield four main objectives: “Energy availability”, “Maintaining profitability of the coal sector”, “Environmental and climate protection” and “Reducing inequalities and employment insecurity”. Pressing social issues, such as severe social inequality and high unemployment, lead to a complex and multi-layered political and social context. While incumbents and powerful coal-favouring actors try to maintain the status quo, there is a slow but steady increase in legislation favouring the uptake of low-carbon alternatives.},
